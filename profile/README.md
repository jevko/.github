**Jevko** is a versatile minimal syntax for encoding tree-structured information as human-friendly text.

Jevko is designed to integrate with and complement familiar formats and programming languages.

It can be used as a building block for simple formats, languages, and notations across a variety of domains.

For example, [**JDAML**](https://jevko.github.io/jdaml/) is an XML-like format built on Jevko that works equally well for data interchange, configuration, *and* text markup.
