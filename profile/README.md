# Jevko: simply encode data 

[`jevko.org`](https://jevko.org) | <a rel="me" href="https://layer8.space/@jevko">`@jevko@layer8.space`</a>

**Jevko** ([/ˈd͡ʒef.kəʊ/](#etymology-and-pronunciation)) is a versatile minimal syntax for encoding tree-structured information as human-friendly text.

It can be used as a building block for simple formats, languages, and notations across a variety of domains.

## For hackers

If you are a hacker, minimalist, language or format designer, are looking for an extremely minimal and simple text-based representation for trees, or just want to learn more about basic Jevko, start with the [comparison](https://jevko.org/#comparison).

## For users

If you are interested in a ready-made minimal and simple unified format that can be a complement or an alternative to formats and syntaxes such as HTML, XML, JSX, JSON, YAML, TOML, etc., check out [Jevko Data And Markup Language (**JDAML**)](https://jevko.org/jdaml.html). 

It is an **experimental** XML-like format built on Jevko that works equally well for data interchange, configuration, and text markup.
