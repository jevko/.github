**Jevko** is a minimal general-purpose syntax that is uniquely suited to seamless manual reading and editing by humans.

It can serve as a portable machine-readable intermediate representation for all kinds of structured information. Because of its simplicity, it maps easily to any existing syntax.

It can also be used as a basic building block for simple and portable formats, languages, and notations in a variety of domains, such as data interchange, configuration, or text markup.
