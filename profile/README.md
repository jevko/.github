# Jevko: simple syntax 

[`jevko.org`](https://jevko.org) | <a rel="me" href="https://layer8.space/@jevko">`@jevko@layer8.space`</a>

**Jevko** ([/ˈd͡ʒef.kəʊ/](#etymology-and-pronunciation)) is a versatile minimal syntax for encoding tree-structured information as human-friendly text.

It can be used as a building block for simple formats, languages, and notations across a variety of domains.

## For hackers

Check out [plain Jevko](https://jevko.org/#plain-jevko) if you are a hacker, minimalist, language or format designer, or are looking for an extremely minimal and simple text-based representation for trees.

## For users

[Jevko Data And Markup Language (**JDAML**)](https://jevko.org/#jdaml) is an **experimental** XML-like format built on Jevko that works equally well for data interchange, configuration, *and* text markup. 

Check out JDAML if you are interested in a ready-made minimal and simple unified format that can be a complement or an alternative to formats and syntaxes such as HTML, XML, JSX, JSON, YAML, TOML, etc.

> I have been developing Jevko and related projects alone over the course of many years, completely independently, without financial support, investing countless amounts of time and effort.
>
> I deeply believe that it is a useful tool that has been missing in almost every programmer's standard toolkit. I think it can become ubiquitous and simplify the lives of not just programmers or hackers, but also regular users of software.
