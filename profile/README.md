[jevko.github.io](https://jevko.github.io) | [jevko.org](https://jevko.org) | [@jevko Mastodon](https://layer8.space/@jevko)

**Jevko** is a minimal general-purpose syntax.

It can be used as a basic building block for simple and portable formats, languages, and notations in a variety of domains, such as data interchange, configuration, or text markup.

Below are a few examples of Jevko formats in different domains, as compared to known formats.

## Data interchange

## Text markup

## Formal specification

While the above formats are still in development, the syntax of Jevko itself is stable and [formally specified](https://github.com/jevko/specifications/blob/master/spec-standard-grammar.md).

It is ready to be used to define custom formats and, more generally, for all kinds of applications that deal with tree-structured information.
